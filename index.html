<p> I've always had very wild dreams about doing something that could benefit others such as becoming a doctor. 
Growing up in the twentieth century with ideas and knowledge at every corner lead me to discover many more job choices that were not only related to medecine but were also as beneficial to humankind.
 Like every other students, I have my weak and strong points in the education system. Biology and chemistry were two of those subjects 
I never really spent hours and hours to try to make sense of, unlike math. I found it really logical and easy to understand which really drew me into it.</p>
