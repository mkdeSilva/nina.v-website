        Growing up, I’ve always been the artistic child in the family. I fell in love with it, regardless of the type of art.
        I loved drawing, reading, writing but also, playing musical instruments. I have started learning violin at the age of 12 and which is today one of my biggest prides. 
        Reading and writing was a  hobby I developed later in life, at the age of 12 I somehow grew this enormous love for the english language, 
        -- probably because it is a lot easier than French -- and started writing my own short novels following by brief poems. 
        It allowed me to progress massively in english over a short period of time.<br>

        My all time favorite hobby, my fondness.
        I’ve been put in a drawing school as soon as seven years old and I loved everything about it. 
        It was a way of expressing my feelings as I was and still am, a shy person. 
        I used to explore every corners of it,and found out I loved drawing portraits and still lifes the most.

The stellar sky a few light years away or the wind brushing over my trembling hands soothing them off. There was a salty smell to it as we were not far from the sea. I walked against the wind with naked feets. Humid grass, cold stones and finally tingling sand, these were all the sensations I felt. For a moment again, I felt whole, these little things filled me in.
      There were no more trees or greens in sight It was plain darkness and I blended in pretty well. I wondered if anyone had noticed my absence. It had been a while since I haven’t gone out of the castle without any guards following me. Damn how free I felt.
      Me and my sorrows all over again."
